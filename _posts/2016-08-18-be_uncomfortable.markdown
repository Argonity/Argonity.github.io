As a new student I struggled most in the very beginning of the program just learning how to adapt to this experience. This isn’t my field (yet), so almost everything about it was so different. Nothing was similar to what I’ve been used to. From using a MacBook for the very first time to learning how to connect with so many new people. Even reading the material and then being quizzed was tough as I haven’t done that in awhile. Some of the labs seemed impossible to solve, spending hours, even days on many of them. Challenging my brain and intelligence in every way. I would even spend so much time just thinking about whether or not I should use the Ask A Question feature for fear of not even knowing how to phrase my question. Everything I had to do thus far was out of my comfort zone. I also felt these feelings were only reserved for me and that everyone else was smooth sailing. I tried to understand why I was feeling this way and then realized...I’ve just been way too comfortable for way too long.

As uncomfortable as this new learning experience may seem at first, it’s exactly how you need to feel if you’re ever going to be great at coding – or anything else for that matter. You need to get out of your comfort zone, and the sooner you do the better and more efficient you will become. Let yourself experience something totally different, you’ll be pleasantly surprised with the results. Go to meetups. Google concepts to better understand them. Read a book on coding. Join a Learn study group – even if you’re not entirely familiar with the topic. Go on and message a fellow Learn student asking for their help on a lab – they’ll be happy to help you out. And the next time you think your question is stupid – ask it! – because it’s not. This is how learning should be – uncomfortable. Have faith in the program and in yourself.

Be confident and keep going. Some concepts may seem impossible to understand at first, but rest assured they'll eventually make sense if you just keep learning. You have the chance to do something amazing and meaningful with your life. Embrace the challenges and start getting uncomfortable!
