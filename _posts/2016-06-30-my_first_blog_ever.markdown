*Why did I choose this?*

**Triggers...**

Several factors combined lead me to my decision to become a programmer. Not in any specific order:

* Becoming fascinated with the startup phenomena taking place all around the world;

* Realizing I needed to future-proof my career;

* Seeing the importance of choosing a career that compliments me and my family's wanted lifestyle;

* Wanting to feel accomplished on a daily basis;

* Wanting to be behind the design and function of some of the most incredible technologies in the world;

* Not wanting my two year old son growing up realizing his dad is a boring oldschool accountant. I want to be able to keep up with him;

* Wanting to work in a friendly, inclusive environment;

* Not wanting to worry about money anymore;  

* Wanting to work with smart people;

* Being unhappy at my current job;

and most of all...

* Wanting to challenge myself and take a risk;

I began reading articles on the web about all these people creating beautifully looking apps and websites, developing clear and simple business models, and eventually starting up their own companies. These people fascinated me in so many ways. They were my age, gutsy and super determined to solve a problem in the world. Nothing stopped them. Not capital, not work, not any competitors. They had an idea and would stop at nothing to share it with the world. That to me was very inspiring.

Majority of these startups had a basic concept in mind - provide a useful, transparent and friendly service directly to consumers and at an affordable rate or even free! Seems like such a simple idea yet it took our complicated world by storm. 

All this made me think: How is this happening? What is the force behind this amazing phenomenon? What's driving their success? The answer was technology. 

Technology was at the core of these businesses. Furthermore, specifically speaking, it was the code! It was the written code which enabled all those technologies to function harmoniously. It was the force behind it all. Code was the reason their service functioned as expected. Code was the reason consumers were able to have a great and satisfying experience with the company. I never realized it before now, but we are constantly exposed to code. I'm blogging on my iPhone right now using Notes which I wouldn't have been able to do without software and without code. Code is everywhere and I wanted to learn more about it. 

I took a class at a local college and did some online tutorials. Both helped me gain an understanding of coding and computer programming however, I wanted something more robust. I knew this was the path I wanted to head down on and so I wanted a program that would allow me to make the career switch. I found out about Flatiron's Learn program and the decision was easy. Im hoping by the beginning of next year 2017 I would have made the switch!

I'm just glad I finally took the plunge!
